# Keeps a Docker Compose deployment up to date: pulls new commits of the checked out branch and rebuilds, and fetches
# Discord's newest web client when discord.com serves a new build. Meant for cron, see "Automatic updates" in
# docs/deploy.md. Every step is skipped when there is nothing new, so it is cheap to run often.
#
# Settings, all optional, as environment variables:
#   ENV_FILE        compose env file, when it isn't .env (for example prod.env)
#   UPDATE_CODE     0 to leave the code alone and only update the web client
#   UPDATE_CLIENT   0 to leave the web client alone and only update the code
#   SERVER_PORT     the server's port on the host's loopback, 3001 unless you changed it in the env file
#   NOTIFY_WEBHOOK  a Discord or LarpCord webhook URL that gets a message when something was updated or went wrong
#   LOCK_FILE       where the lock that stops two runs overlapping lives, /tmp/larpcord-auto-update.lock by default
