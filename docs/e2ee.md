# End-to-end encrypted messages

DMs and group DMs encrypt new messages and attachments by default. Ordinary password signup and login create or unlock the encrypted key backup in the background; users can start chatting without an encryption setup step. Private-channel encryption is required, including for bot, application and webhook message sends; there is no private plaintext opt-out. The server defaults `limits.e2ee.trustServerByDefault` to `true`. Guild text channels remain outside this implementation, and earlier plaintext messages stay plaintext.

## Protocol

The MVP uses a sealed box per recipient device. For every message the sending client:

1. generates a random 256-bit content key and encrypts the payload once with AES-256-GCM,
2. wraps the content key to each recipient device's signed X25519 prekey with HPKE base mode (DHKEM X25519, HKDF-SHA256, AES-256-GCM),
3. signs the envelope with its Ed25519 device key.

Everything runs on WebCrypto with non-extractable keys in IndexedDB. HPKE comes from `@hpke/core` and `@hpke/dhkem-x25519` (MIT). If they refuse non-extractable keys, HPKE base mode is about 100 lines on top of WebCrypto and gets checked against the RFC 9180 test vectors.

The MVP has no per-message forward secrecy. Weekly prekey rotation with old private prekeys deleted after 30 days gives a coarse version of it. The upgrade path is MLS (RFC 9420) through `ts-mls` (MIT, pure TypeScript) behind envelope version 2, used first for group DMs and then guild channels. The MVP's identity and device keys become the MLS credentials, so verification carries over. We skip a Signal-style double ratchet because guild channels would need a second protocol anyway.

## Keys

- User identity key, Ed25519, one per user. It signs device records, and safety numbers are computed over it, so verifying a contact once covers all their devices.
- Device signing key, Ed25519, one per browser profile.
- Signed prekey, X25519, rotated every 7 days.

A new device registers as pending. Peers only encrypt to it once the identity key signs it. The new device gets the identity key from the key backup, unlocked by the account password, by a recovery code, or by another device approving it over the gateway. The next section covers all three.

The server ties each device to the session that registered it, and the client re-links its stored device to the current session every time it loads. Logging a session out, whether from that browser, from Logged-in Devices or through a password change, revokes the devices that no longer belong to a live session, so senders stop wrapping keys to them.

The server rejects a send with `409 E2EE_DEVICE_MISMATCH` when the envelope skips an active device of any recipient, including the sender's own other devices. The client then refetches keys and re-encrypts before the UI sees a failure. This check catches incomplete recipient lists. The server stores ciphertext and sealed backups; it does not receive message content keys or the unsealed backup secret. The default client does trust the server to identify users and authenticate signed-in sessions, as described below.

Safety numbers use Signal's numeric fingerprint, 60 digits compared by voice or in person. Nothing can scan a code yet, so the dialog shows no QR code. In the default trusted-server mode, a contact's directory identity can change without a review dialog. The client keeps previously accepted public keys for historical signatures and clears the verified mark when an unsigned identity change is accepted. Device identity signatures, signed prekeys, backup signatures and message signatures are still checked; an invalid device signature is never accepted.

Settings > Encryption offers **Require safety checks in this browser** as an advanced, per-browser option. This restores explicit review of unsigned contact identity changes and manual browser approval. A changed identity blocks sending until reviewed, and the draft stays in the composer. Signed rotations from an already trusted identity keep the verified state in either mode. Disabling the server's `trustServerByDefault` setting also enables strict behavior.

Marking a contact as verified, removing the mark and accepting a changed safety number follow the user to their other browsers. Each browser keeps a list of contacts with the identity key it trusts, the verified flag and the time it changed. The list is sealed with AES-256-GCM under a key that HKDF derives from the backup secret, and stored in the backup row with its own version. A browser that changes an entry merges it into the stored list, the newer change per contact wins, and the server tells the user's other sessions with `E2EE_TRUST_UPDATE` so they merge it too. The server can't read or forge the list, because it never sees the backup secret. A browser that meets a contact for the first time through the list trusts the key another of the user's browsers saw, instead of trusting whatever the server serves first. A reset makes a new backup secret, so it starts the list over.

## Key backup and new devices

Every browser profile and origin is its own device. Without a backup, a new device can't sign itself and can't read anything sent before it existed. The key backup fixes both, and it's on by default.

The device that holds the identity key creates a random 32-byte backup secret and an X25519 backup keypair. The server stores one `E2eeKeyBackup` row per user:

- the identity private key and the backup private key, each sealed with AES-256-GCM under a key derived from the backup secret with HKDF,
- the backup public key, signed by the identity key so peers can check it,
- the backup secret itself, sealed under a key derived from the password or the recovery code, with the KDF name, its parameters and a random 16-byte salt,
- a version number, so two devices can't overwrite each other's changes.

Content keys reach the backup in two ways. Every new envelope carries a `backup` list with the content key sealed to each member's backup public key, covered by the envelope signature. For older messages, a device that can read a message uploads its content key sealed to its own backup key into `E2eeBackupKey`, one row per user and message id. The sealed key is bound to the user, the message id and the envelope signature, so an edit invalidates the old row. When a device first gets the backup key it walks the history of every encrypted conversation once and uploads what's missing.

### Password mode

This is the default. The client patch hooks `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/register` and `PATCH /users/@me` in the HTTP client, so it sees the password before it leaves the browser and uses it only after the server accepts it. It derives a 32-byte key with Argon2id from `hash-wasm` (64 MiB, 3 iterations, parallelism 1) and the salt in the backup row. Nothing derived from the password goes to the server, only the sealed secret.

- After the first login, the device creates the identity and the backup in one go.
- A device that holds the identity but never saw the password, such as a session from before the backup existed or a QR login, doesn't create a backup without a sealed secret. Default mode keeps background linking active without opening a dialog. Settings > Encryption retains a password field that checks `POST /users/@me/e2ee/password` before creating or sealing the backup; strict mode also shows the explicit composer notice.
- On a new browser, logging in fetches the backup, unseals the secret, restores the identity key, signs the new device and decrypts the history. There are no prompts. Until the backup opens, the tab keeps the password in `sessionStorage`, sealed with AES-GCM under a non-extractable key stored in IndexedDB, for at most 10 minutes. A reload right after the login response still unlocks the browser, and the entry is deleted once the backup opens or the password is used.
- If the identity was made on a browser that never saw the password and no backup exists yet, a password login on another browser can't restore it. When the user has no encrypted conversations there is nothing to lose, so that browser resets encryption with the password it just saw, becomes the identity holder and creates the backup. The old browser finds its device revoked and later unlocks from the backup like any other.
- A password change reseals the backup secret under the new password with a fresh salt. The backup keypair stays, so no content key needs resealing. If the browser doing the change doesn't hold the secret, it unseals it with the old password first.
- If a device holds the secret and logs in with a password that doesn't open the backup, it reseals the backup with that password, since the login just proved it's correct.

Users from before the backup existed have an identity key that WebCrypto created as non-extractable, so it can't be put in a backup. On the next login the device holding it creates a new identity key, signs a rotation statement with the old one, re-signs all devices that the old key had signed, and then creates the backup. Peers accept a rotation signed by the identity key they already trust without a safety number warning and keep the verified state. Other devices of the same user follow the rotation the same way.

### Recovery-code mode

In Settings > Encryption the backup can switch to a recovery code: 32 characters from Crockford's base32 alphabet, about 160 bits, shown once as a grid of four-character groups. The code only replaces the password lock after the user clicks "I saved it", and the dialog can't be closed with Escape or a backdrop click while the code is on screen. The secret is then sealed under HKDF-SHA256 of the code, and the password no longer opens it. A new browser doesn't interrupt the user after login. Default mode first tries to link through another authenticated, unlocked browser, without an approval or recovery dialog. If no browser can supply the secret, the draft remains in the composer and the required account-password prompt verifies the account before retrying silent linking; the client never resets historical keys or sends plaintext to work around missing keys. Strict safety mode exposes the Unlock notice and recovery dialog. The Encryption settings retain manual recovery controls in either mode. Switching back to the password asks for it and checks it with `POST /users/@me/e2ee/password` before resealing, which works for accounts without an email.

### Resetting encryption

When the recovery code is lost and no other browser can approve a new one, the unlock dialog and the settings page offer "Reset encryption". After a warning and the account password, the browser generates a new identity key and calls `POST /users/@me/e2ee/reset` with the password and the new public key. The server checks the password, revokes every device, deletes the backup and the stored message keys and stores the new identity in one request, so another online device can't race it with an identity of its own. The browser wipes its local keys, signs a new device and creates a new password-mode backup. The user's own browsers can't read the old messages anymore and show them as "Sent before encryption was reset" with no button, since no device or backup can bring those keys back. Other browsers of the user need approval again, and they ask for it on their own as soon as they find their device revoked. Contacts in strict safety mode see a safety number change; default mode accepts the new directory identity after validating its signed device records. Both keep reading what they already received: the revoked devices stay on the server with their `revoked_at`, and a client still accepts a revoked device's signature for a message sent before that time, as long as the device was signed by an identity key it trusted for that user before. Each client remembers the identity keys it trusted earlier for every contact and for its own account.

The tabs of one browser share IndexedDB, so a tab that wipes or resets its keys tells the others over the `BroadcastChannel`, and they reload their state. Key setup runs under a Web Lock per user, so two tabs never register two devices at once.

### Approving from another device

A locked device sends `E2EE_LINK_REQUEST` through `POST /users/@me/e2ee/link`, which the server relays to the user's own sessions only. The exchange commits to the new device's ephemeral key before the approver reveals its own, so the server can't grind a matching code:

1. The new device sends a request with its name and the SHA-256 of an ephemeral X25519 public key.
2. Each online device that holds the backup secret answers with its own ephemeral public key. The server only relays answers, approvals, denials and invites from active devices. Tabs of one browser share the device, so only one of them answers: the tabs elect a leader with the Web Locks API and talk over a `BroadcastChannel`. The leader does the key exchange and the other tabs show the same prompt and code, forwarding Approve and Deny to it. A tab whose session the server no longer accepts gives up the leader lock, so a follower's request is never stuck behind it.
3. The new device collects answers for 1.2 seconds, up to four, then reveals its public key to each of them and ignores later answers, so the server can't pick an approver key after seeing the requester's. Each approver checks the key against the commitment.
4. In strict safety mode, every approver shows "New login on Mac OS X • Chrome" with the time the browser signed in and its location, Approve and Deny, and a six-digit code computed from the request id and both public keys. Browsers are named from the session's operating system and browser, the same way Logged-in Devices names them, and fall back to the name the browser registered with. The new device lists one code per approver under the approver's name. When two devices have the same name, the name gets the time the device was added, with seconds if the minutes match.
5. In default mode, an unlocked browser automatically approves only a requesting device that the server associates with a currently signed-in session of the same account and that is not revoked. It still checks the ephemeral-key commitment and uses the same encrypted exchange. No approval dialog or comparison code is shown. In strict mode the user chooses Approve or Deny. Approve seals the backup secret with AES-GCM under HKDF of the X25519 shared secret. The new device unseals it and continues as if it had entered the password. Deny revokes the pending device and signs its session out, the same way Remove does, so the denied browser shows the denial on the login page and can only ask again after someone signs in there again. The first Approve or Deny wins, and the other approvers close their prompt as soon as they see it.

The new device repeats its request every 10 seconds for 5 minutes while nobody has answered, so a device that comes online later still gets the prompt. If every approver it is comparing codes with stops being active, it starts a new request. It sends one request per browser, from the leader tab, when it loads locked and when it becomes locked mid-session, unless the user snoozed the unlock dialog. When it unlocks another way, the user clicks "Not now" or the tab closes, it sends a `cancel` stage, a keepalive `fetch` on `pagehide` in the last case, and the prompt disappears on every other device.

A pending device in Settings > Encryption > Your devices has an Approve button on every unlocked browser. It sends an `invite` stage to that device, which then starts a request as if the user had clicked "Ask for approval" there.

### Devices

Every device row remembers the session that registered it, and `GET /users/@me/e2ee?device_id=` updates it when the same browser signs in again. The state endpoint adds the session's last activity and location to the user's own devices. Removing a device in the settings asks for confirmation, revokes it and logs its session out. A browser that finds its own device revoked deletes its identity key, backup secret, device key and prekeys, so it has to go through the password, the recovery code or an approval again. Logging out with User Settings > Log Out deletes the same keys right away, so a shared machine doesn't keep the secret that opens the backup. Pending devices are revoked once their session is gone or after 7 days.

The settings are in User Settings, under Encryption, next to Data & Privacy, and also open from the safety numbers dialog.

### What the user sees

Normal private chats have a quiet encryption status in the header and no lock attached to each successfully decrypted message. New conversations do not require a Turn On action. Password login unlocks the backup automatically; a signed-in browser can link another authenticated browser in the background. Default mode does not open encryption setup, safety-review, approval or recovery dialogs automatically. If background unlock cannot finish, the browser requires the account password in a simple prompt with no skip or plaintext bypass. The header status uses a dim, neutral color.

While keys are loading, messages show "Decrypting…" or "Preparing private chat…" and fill in when keys arrive. Sending waits for bootstrap and validated recipient devices. If preparation cannot finish, the draft remains in the composer with a short status message and, when this browser needs authentication, a required account-password prompt; nothing is sent as plaintext. An account password cannot open a recovery-code-only backup by itself. When no other unlocked browser can supply its keys, the prompt explains that limitation and leaves history intact; manual recovery stays in advanced settings. Missing historical keys and failed ciphertext remain clearly marked. Lost history is never silently reset. Manual recovery and destructive reset controls remain available in Encryption settings, with password checks and confirmation.

The advanced strict safety option restores Unlock controls and explicit contact verification and browser approval. Enabling encryption explicitly on an older conversation still posts its system notice; previous plaintext messages are not rewritten. Forwarding, polls and unsupported attachment flows stay disabled in encrypted conversations because the server rejects plaintext or incompatible payloads there.

## Message format

Encrypted messages carry a new `encrypted` field. `content` holds a fallback string the server writes itself, so mentions, search and push notifications never see plaintext.

```json
{
    "content": "🔒 Encrypted message",
    "nonce": "...",
    "flags": 4,
    "encrypted": {
        "v": 1,
        "alg": "x25519-hpke-aes256gcm-ed25519",
        "sender_device": "...",
        "iv": "...",
        "ct": "...",
        "keys": [{ "user_id": "...", "device_id": "...", "prekey_id": 3, "enc": "...", "wrapped": "..." }],
        "sig": "..."
    }
}
```

The AEAD additional data binds the channel id, the sender, the sender device and the nonce, so a ciphertext can't be moved to another channel or replayed. Encrypted messages never get link embeds. Reactions, pins, typing, read states and reply structure stay in plaintext.

The encrypted payload is JSON with `content` and, when the message has them, `attachments` and `stickers`. Polls and clips aren't encrypted, so the attach menu disables "Create Poll" and clips in an encrypted DM and the server rejects them there.

### Attachments

Files go through Discord's normal cloud upload flow, and the client rewrites each step in the HTTP client hook:

1. `POST /channels/:id/attachments` gets a random `.bin` file name, the ciphertext size, `application/octet-stream` as the content type and no `X-Discord-Original-MD5` header. The client remembers the upload by its `upload_url` and `upload_filename`.
2. The `PUT` to the upload URL carries the file encrypted with a fresh AES-256-GCM key and nonce. The file is cut into 64 KiB chunks, each sealed with the nonce XORed with the chunk index and an AAD that names the index and marks the last chunk, so chunks can't be reordered or dropped. Before encrypting, the client reads the width and height of images and the size and duration of videos.
3. The message send replaces each attachment with `{ id, filename, uploaded_filename }`, where `filename` is the `.bin` name. The real file name, content type, size, dimensions, alt text, spoiler flag, voice message duration and waveform, and the key and nonce go into the encrypted payload. Stickers move from `sticker_ids` into the payload as `{ id, name, format_type }`.

The server only accepts attachments in an encrypted channel when the stored name matches `[a-z0-9]+.bin`, the content type is `application/octet-stream`, there are no dimensions and the request carries no alt text, title, waveform, duration, spoiler or clip fields. It answers anything else with `E2EE_PLAINTEXT_ATTACHMENT`.

After decrypting a message, the client matches each payload entry to the server attachment with the same `.bin` name and rewrites the attachment with the real metadata and a virtual URL, `/e2ee/attachments/<channel>/<attachment>/<name>`, as both `url` and `proxy_url`. A service worker registered at `/e2ee-sw.js` with root scope answers those URLs. On a miss it asks the open tabs over a `MessageChannel` for the real CDN URL and the key, downloads the ciphertext, decrypts it and keeps up to 256 MiB of plaintext in memory. It ignores the query strings Discord appends, answers `Range` requests so videos and voice messages can seek, and serves only images, video, audio and PDF with their own type. Text types are served as `text/plain`, everything else as an `application/octet-stream` download, and every response carries `nosniff` and a sandboxing CSP, so a hostile file can't run script on the instance's origin. Discord asks for video thumbnails with `?format=`, and the worker answers those with the first frame, which the tab that asked renders on a canvas. Encryption waits for the worker to control the page, for up to 8 seconds, before it reports ready. The server answers `/e2ee/attachments/*` with a 404, so a page without the worker shows a broken file instead of the app.

Edits keep the attachments of the decrypted original in the new payload. Removing one attachment sends a `PATCH` with only the kept attachment ids and `.bin` names and re-encrypts the payload without the removed entry. A message whose decrypted content is empty, such as a sticker or a voice message, is refreshed through Vencord's `updateMessage` after a local `MESSAGE_UPDATE`, because Discord's partial message update ignores empty content and sticker changes.

Search in an encrypted DM never reaches the server. The client answers `GET /channels/:id/messages/search` and `POST /channels/:id/messages/search/tabs` itself from the decrypted copies of the last 1000 messages, matching every word of the query and the author filter.

## Client integration

A small loader in `assets/client_patches/10-e2ee-loader.js` pushes a fake chunk into `webpackChunkdiscord_app` to get the bundle's module require, then finds modules by shape and never by numeric id, since ids change every build:

- the Flux dispatcher, through `addInterceptor`, for history, pins, search and mention loads,
- the gateway socket's `getDispatchHandler`, wrapping the `preload` step of `MESSAGE_CREATE` and `MESSAGE_UPDATE`. The socket only flushes events whose preload has finished, so async decryption can't reorder messages, and notifications see plaintext,
- the HTTP client object with `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch` and `del`, to decrypt REST responses,
- the message queue's `drain`, to encrypt sends and edits.

The heavy code is bundled with esbuild into `assets/public/e2ee/e2ee.js`. The `fosscordE2ee` Vencord plugin connects it to Discord's own UI: a pre-send hook that keeps a refused message in the composer, the attach menu changes, a message re-render hook for decrypted messages, and the Encryption page in User Settings. When the loader can't find a hook it shows an "E2EE unavailable in this client build" banner and refuses to send in encrypted channels. It never falls back to plaintext. `scripts/e2ee-anchors.js` checks the anchor strings after every `npm run generate:client`.

The UI supplies a quiet private-chat header status and an Encryption page in User Settings for key backup, recovery, device management and the advanced strict safety option. Healthy decrypted messages have no extra lock decoration. Default mode prepares private chats automatically; explicit verification and review dialogs remain available when requested or when strict safety checks are enabled.

If the server rate limits device registration, the browser doesn't fail closed for good. Encrypted conversations show a notice that names the wait, and setup retries by itself once the limit expires.

## Server work

- Entities `E2eeIdentity` and `E2eeDevice`, a channel encryption state, and a nullable `encrypted` jsonb column on messages, plus a migration.
- Routes under `users/@me/e2ee` for the identity, devices and prekeys, `POST /e2ee/keys/query` limited to users who share a channel or relationship, and `PUT /channels/:id/e2ee`.
- `handleMessage` validates envelopes. It checks the shape, a size limit of `limits.e2ee.maxEnvelopeBytes` (64 KiB by default), that the sender device belongs to the sender and isn't revoked, and that no recipient device is missing. Then it forces the fallback content, empty embeds and the suppress-embeds flag. It also rejects plaintext sends into encrypted channels, and rejects forwards, polls, plaintext stickers, attachments that aren't opaque `.bin` files, and components there.
- Gateway events `E2EE_DEVICES_UPDATE`, `E2EE_IDENTITY_UPDATE`, `E2EE_TRUST_UPDATE`, `CHANNEL_E2EE_UPDATE` and `E2EE_LINK_REQUEST`/`E2EE_LINK_RESPONSE`.
- `POST /users/@me/e2ee/password` to check the account password and `POST /users/@me/e2ee/reset` to start over with a new identity. `PUT /channels/:id/e2ee` answers `E2EE_RECIPIENT_NO_DEVICES` with the `user_ids` that have no active device, so the client can name them.
- Rate limits for key queries, device registration, prekey rotation, password checks and resets. Registration counts only new device ids, `limits.e2ee.deviceRegistrationsPerHour` (30 by default), and re-signing an existing device has its own limit, `deviceUpdatesPerHour` (60). Key queries follow `keyQueriesPerMinute` (60). Operators can change these and the pending device lifetime from the admin dashboard's Site settings, and the new values apply without a restart. The generic `/users/@me` write limit skips the e2ee routes, which all have their own.
- `E2eeKeyBackup` and `E2eeBackupKey`, with `GET`, `PUT` and `PATCH /users/@me/e2ee/backup`, `POST /users/@me/e2ee/backup/keys`, `POST /users/@me/e2ee/backup/keys/query` and `PUT /users/@me/e2ee/backup/trust`, which replaces the sealed verification list when the request names its current version. All of them only touch the caller's own rows. Uploads are capped at 100 keys a request and only accepted for encrypted messages in the caller's channels. `PUT /users/@me/e2ee/identity` accepts a rotation when it's signed by the current identity key.

## What it doesn't protect

The server ships the client JavaScript, so a malicious operator can ship a client that leaks keys. That is the limit of any E2EE on the web. Publishing the patch bundle hash and a pinning extension or desktop wrapper reduce it. Metadata is visible to the server: who talks to whom, when, sizes, reactions and read state. For files that includes the number of attachments, each ciphertext size, which is the file size plus 16 bytes per 64 KiB, and the voice message flag. Sticker images still load from the instance's CDN, so the server sees which sticker a client renders. Default mode trusts the server key directory, including later identity changes and the server's claim that a requesting browser is signed in to the same account. A compromised server could substitute identities or authorize a device link; default mode does not independently prove those claims to the user. Strict safety mode adds contact pinning, safety-number comparison and explicit approval instead. Neither mode escrows an unsealed backup secret with the server. Discord's own analytics and Sentry code runs in the same page, so their payloads need auditing to keep plaintext out.

Password mode trades some of that protection for convenience. Whoever holds a copy of the database has the salt and the sealed secret, so they can guess passwords offline, at the cost of one 64 MiB Argon2id run per guess. A weak or reused password makes the encryption about as strong as that password. Recovery-code mode avoids this, because 160 random bits can't be guessed, but losing the code and every signed-in device means losing the history. The backup secret also sits in each unlocked browser's IndexedDB, so malware with access to the profile can read it there.
